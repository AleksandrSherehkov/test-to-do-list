# ToDo List Project

Welcome to the ToDo List Project! This is a React.js application designed to help you manage your daily tasks efficiently. Built with modern technologies like Redux for state management and Tailwind CSS for styling, this project demonstrates best practices and modern front-end development techniques.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Easily add, complete, and delete tasks from your to-do list.
- **Character Limit:** A new record is only added if its length is less than or equal to 50 characters, ensuring concise task descriptions.
- **Task Status Toggling:** Switch between Completed/Not Completed status with a simple click on the task name.
- **Filtering:** View tasks filtered by their status - All, Completed, or Current, making it easy to focus on what's important.
- **Task Counters:** Visual counters for both completed and uncompleted tasks, helping you track your progress.
- **Redux Storage:** State management is handled via Redux, ensuring a predictable state container across the app.
- **Stylish UI:** Utilizing Tailwind CSS, the UI is responsive, accessible, and pleasing to the eye.
